The $47,000 Mistake
Meet Jennifer.
She bought her dream home in Tampa three years ago. A beautiful 2,400 sq ft property with a spacious backyard. Six months after closing, she decided to screen in the back patio and add a small storage shed. Her contractor-recommended by a neighbor-quoted $12,000 for both.
"Do we need permits?" Jennifer asked.
"Nah, this is small stuff. Permits are a hassle and they just add cost. Trust me, nobody pulls permits for this kind of work."
The work was done in three weeks. It looked great. Life went on.
Fast forward to last month. Jennifer accepted a job offer in Orlando and put her house on the market. During the buyer's inspection, the inspector noted the screened patio and shed in his report. He checked the county permit database.
No permits. Red flag.
The buyer's attorney demanded one of three options:
1. Remove all unpermitted structures
2. Obtain after-the-fact permits and bring everything to code (which could mean tearing down and rebuilding)
3. Reduce the sale price by $47,000 to cover potential liability
Jennifer tried to get retroactive permits. The county inspector came out and found the shed was 3 feet too close to the property line. The screened patio lacked proper footing. Both had to be demolished and rebuilt-at her expense-before permits would be issued.
Total cost to fix: $28,000. The original contractor? Unreachable. Jennifer had to hire someone new.
The buyer walked away during the delay. When Jennifer finally relisted the home, the market had shifted. She sold for $35,000 less than the original offer.
Total damage: $47,000.
All because she didn't understand Florida's permit system.
The Problem: Nobody Teaches You This
When you close on your Florida home, you get a massive stack of paperwork. Title documents. Mortgage agreements. Insurance policies. What you don't get is the owner's manual.
Nobody sits you down and explains:
• How Florida's permit system actually works
• Which projects need permits (spoiler: more than you think)
• How to check if your house already has unpermitted work
• What red flags to watch for when hiring contractors
• How unpermitted work destroys your home's value
You're left to figure it out yourself. Usually the hard way. Usually expensive.


Chapter 1: Understanding Florida's Permit System
Let's start with the truth: Florida's permit system exists to protect you.
Not to create bureaucracy. Not to enrich the county. It exists because Florida's climate is brutal. Hurricanes. Flooding. Extreme heat. Termites. Foundation issues. Electrical failures in humidity.
When construction is done to code and properly inspected, your home can withstand these forces. When it's not, your home becomes a liability.
What Actually Requires a Permit in Florida
This varies by county, but here are the rules that apply in most of Florida:
REQUIRES PERMITNO PERMIT NEEDED• Any structural changes • Room additions • Garage conversions • Screened enclosures over 100 sq ft • Electrical work (new circuits, panel upgrades) • Plumbing work (new fixtures, water heaters) • Roof replacement • Fences over 6 feet tall • Sheds over 200 sq ft • Driveways (in some counties) • Swimming pools & hot tubs• Interior painting • Flooring replacement • Cabinet replacement • Appliance replacement • Minor plumbing repairs • Small landscaping • Fences under 6 feet • Sheds under 200 sq ft • Window/door replacement (same size) • Cosmetic repairs
CRITICAL WARNING:
When in doubt, call your county's building department. A 5-minute phone call can save you $50,000 in headaches later. Never trust a contractor who says 'we don't need permits for this.'


Chapter 2: How to Check for Unpermitted Work
Before you panic about whether YOUR home has unpermitted work, let's walk through how to check. This is actually easier than you think.
Step 1: Identify What Could Be Unpermitted
Walk around your property with a critical eye. Look for:
• Room additions or enclosed areas (Florida rooms, sunrooms, garages converted to living space)
• Structures in the yard (sheds, workshops, screened patios)
• Pools, hot tubs, or water features
• Major electrical panels or outdoor wiring
• Replaced roofs or major roof work
• Fences over 6 feet
Step 2: Search Your County's Permit Database
Every Florida county maintains a public permit database. Here's how to access it:
Method 1: Online Search (Recommended)
4. Google '[Your County Name] Florida building permits search'
5. Look for the official county government website (.gov domain)
6. Enter your property address
7. Review ALL permits ever issued for your property
Method 2: In-Person or Phone
If online search isn't available or you need help:
• Call your county's Building Department during business hours
• Provide your property address and ask for a permit history report
• This is a public record-they cannot refuse


Step 3: Compare What You See vs. What's Permitted
This is where it gets real. You've got your permit history. Now compare it to your property.
RED FLAGS:
• You have a screened patio but there's no permit for it in the records
• Your garage was converted to a bedroom but there's no permit
• A permit shows 'ISSUED' but not 'FINALED' (this means inspection was never completed)
• The square footage on permits doesn't match what you actually have
What To Do If You Find Unpermitted Work
Don't panic. But don't ignore it either. Here are your options:
Option 1: Get Retroactive Permits
Most counties allow you to apply for permits after the work is done. You'll need:
• A licensed contractor to pull the permit
• Potentially to expose the work for inspection (yes, this might mean opening walls)
• To bring everything up to current code (this is where it gets expensive)
• To pay permit fees plus penalties (usually double the normal fee)
Option 2: Remove the Unpermitted Work
Sometimes it's cheaper to tear down a shed or remove a fence than to deal with permits. Calculate the cost of both options.
Option 3: Disclose and Negotiate
If you're selling, you can disclose the unpermitted work and either:
• Reduce the sale price to account for it
• Offer a credit to the buyer to handle it themselves
• Find a cash buyer who accepts it as-is (expect a significant discount)


Chapter 3: How to Vet Contractors (So You Don't Get Burned)
Let's talk about Marcus.
Marcus hired a contractor to remodel his kitchen. The guy seemed great-professional, good reviews on Google, competitive price. Work started.
Three weeks in, the contractor stopped showing up. Phone calls went to voicemail. Texts were ignored. Marcus was left with a half-demolished kitchen, no appliances, exposed plumbing, and $18,000 already paid.
The contractor had skipped town. His license? Expired. His insurance? Fake. Marcus had never checked.
The Hard Truth About Florida Contractors
Florida has more unlicensed, uninsured, and outright fraudulent contractors than almost any state. Why? Because:
• The state is constantly growing-demand is high
• Hurricanes create urgent repair needs that criminals exploit
• Many homeowners don't know how to verify credentials
• By the time you realize you've been scammed, the contractor is gone
Your job is to verify EVERYTHING before signing a contract or paying a deposit.


The 10-Point Contractor Vetting Checklist
Use this checklist EVERY TIME you hire someone for work over $1,000. Non-negotiable.
? 1. Verify Their License
Go to: MyFloridaLicense.com/dbpr Search by name or license number Check: • Is the license active (not expired or suspended)? • Does the license type match the work they're doing? • Are there any disciplinary actions or complaints?
? 2. Confirm Insurance Coverage
Ask for: • Certificate of General Liability Insurance • Certificate of Workers' Compensation Insurance  CALL the insurance company directly to verify the policy is active. Don't just accept the certificate-they can be faked.
? 3. Get Multiple Written Quotes
Get at least 3 quotes. Each quote should include: • Detailed scope of work • Materials to be used (brand names and specifications) • Timeline with start and completion dates • Payment schedule • Permit responsibility (who pulls them) • Warranty information
? 4. Check References
Ask for 3 recent references (within the last year). Call them and ask: • Did the contractor finish on time? • Did they stay within budget? • Was the quality good? • Did they handle permits properly? • Would you hire them again? • Any issues or concerns?
? 5. Search Court Records
Search your county's clerk of court website for the contractor's name. Look for: • Liens filed against them • Lawsuits from other homeowners • Judgments or bankruptcies  Red flags here mean walk away.
? 6. Verify Their Business Address
Legitimate contractors have a real business address (not a PO Box). Drive by if possible. Fly-by-night operators often use fake addresses or residential addresses.
? 7. Review the Contract Thoroughly
Never sign a contract without: • Detailed scope of work • Fixed price or detailed cost breakdown • Payment schedule (NEVER more than 10% upfront) • Timeline with penalties for delays • Permit clause (who pulls them and pays for them) • Warranty terms • Cleanup and disposal responsibilities • Change order process
? 8. Confirm Permit Responsibility
Make sure the contract explicitly states: • Who is pulling permits (it should be the contractor) • Who is paying for permits • That work cannot begin without permits approved • That final payment is contingent on permit finaling
? 9. Establish a Payment Schedule
NEVER pay more than 10% upfront. A reasonable payment schedule: • 10% deposit to start • 25% at rough-in inspection • 25% at substantial completion • 40% at final inspection and permit finaling  If a contractor demands 50% upfront, walk away.
? 10. Trust Your Gut
If something feels off, it probably is. Red flags include: • Pressure to sign immediately • Unusually low bids (way below others) • Reluctance to provide references • Vague contract terms • No written warranty • Cash-only payment requests • Unwillingness to pull permits
