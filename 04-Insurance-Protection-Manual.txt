Navigate Insurance Chaos and Prepare for Hurricanes


The $24,000 Surprise
Lisa bought her home in Fort Myers in 2019. Her insurance premium was $1,800/year. Reasonable.
Then came Hurricane Ian in 2022. She filed no claims-her house was fine. But her insurance company went bankrupt. She was forced onto Citizens Property Insurance.
Her new premium: $8,200/year. A 355% increase.
She called other carriers. All declined coverage or quoted even higher. She was trapped.
Then a neighbor mentioned wind mitigation. Lisa paid $500 for an inspection and submitted the report. Her premium dropped to $5,600. Still painful, but a $2,600 annual savings.
If she'd known about wind mitigation earlier, she could have saved $2,600 every year since purchase. That's $18,200 thrown away.
Chapter 1: Understanding Florida's Insurance Crisis
Florida's homeowner insurance market is broken. Here's why:
• Hurricane losses have driven major carriers out of the state
• Citizens (state-run insurer) has become insurer of last resort for 1.2M+ homes
• Premiums have tripled in many areas
• Roof age restrictions (many carriers won't insure homes with roofs 15+ years old)
Wind Mitigation: Your Best Tool
Wind mitigation features can reduce your premium by 20-45%. Here's what inspectors look for:
• Roof shape (hip roofs get bigger discounts than gable)
• Roof-to-wall attachment (clips, straps, or trusses)
• Roof deck attachment (how sheathing is attached to trusses)
• Opening protection (impact-resistant windows/doors or shutters)
• Secondary water resistance (sealed roof deck)
GET A WIND MITIGATION INSPECTION. Cost: $75-150. Potential savings: $500-3,000/year.


Chapter 2: Flood Insurance Reality
Hurricane damage is covered by your homeowner's policy. Flood damage is NOT.
Who Needs Flood Insurance
If your mortgage requires it, you need it. But even if it doesn't:
• 25% of flood claims come from outside high-risk zones
• Heavy rain can cause flooding anywhere
• 1 inch of water causes $25,000+ in damage
Cost vs. Coverage
NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) coverage:
• Up to $250,000 for structure
• Up to $100,000 for contents
• Cost: $400-2,000/year depending on zone


Chapter 3: Hurricane Prep Checklist
When hurricane season arrives, most people panic-buy supplies. Smart homeowners prepare months in advance.
Off-Season (December-May)
? Get wind mitigation inspection and update insurance
? Trim trees and remove dead branches
? Inspect roof and make repairs
? Install hurricane shutters or impact windows
? Review insurance coverage and document home contents
72 Hours Before Storm
? Fill bathtubs and containers with water
? Secure outdoor furniture and objects
? Charge all devices and power banks
? Fill gas tank
? Photograph your home for insurance purposes


Conclusion: Insurance is Protection, Not a Bet
In Florida, insurance isn't optional. It's survival.
Get wind mitigation. Consider flood insurance. Prepare for hurricanes before the panic starts. Review your policy annually.
Your home is your biggest asset. Protect it.
